# Graphinx

Sphinx for GraphQL APIs.

## Getting Started

1. Add Graphinx to your dev dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn add --dev graphinx
   ```

2. Initialize a config file

   ```bash
   yarn graphinx --init
   ```

## Configuration

Configuration is done through a `.graphinx.yaml` config file. The path to the config file can be changed with `--config`.

A JSON schema is available at <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ewen-lbh/graphinx/main/config.schema.json>. The documentation below is generated from it, but right now is missing documentation for nested objects...

<!-- Include docs/config.md -->

## Template authoring

Docs TBD.
